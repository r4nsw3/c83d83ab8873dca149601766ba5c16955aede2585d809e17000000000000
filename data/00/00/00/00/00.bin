  |   WHAT IF YOU CONTROLLED THE NEWS?                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A stack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each       |
  |   side - green to approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is        |
  |   hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the   |
  |   loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse            |
  |   nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried    |
  |   about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic       |
  |   alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an           |
  |   important investor? Will you support current government, as           |
  |   tensions grow between the neighboring country?                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the      |
  |   very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry      |
  |   bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into         |
  |   peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every   |
  |   step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen?    |
  |   Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or      |
  |   stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your       |
  |   co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing         |
  |   xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian       |
  |   struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy,   |
  |   a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his    |
  |   store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day          |
  |   provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their     |
  |   beliefs.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of      |
  |   the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought     |
  |   with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the         |
  |   window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a         |
  |   drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors    |
  |   locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with     |
  |   piles of cash?                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   After good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new   |
  |   articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Update Notes: v1.3.6sw (v65536). Firmware 9.0.1 and master key 7.0    |
  |   are required. The version number does really look like that.          |
